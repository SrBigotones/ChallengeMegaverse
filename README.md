# ChallengeMegaverse
## Create your own megaverse*

*Megaverse is like Metaverse but cooler because you create it!

## Problem
Your job as the master of the megaverse will be to create one with some given parameters and shapes. You will use a megaverse creator API to help you with such legendary quest.

The challenge is composed of 2 phases. In the first one you will learn how to interact with the API and create some ü™êPOLYanets and validate them. In the second one you will create a bigger megaverse with some peculiar shape.

## Solution
Problem solved with node+typescript.  
Using the service StarMap as the facade between the user and the API.  
The service layer, contains all methods for the user to interact with the API.  

This approach works for both phases with the same methods.

## Requirements
Create an .env file at the root of the project with the variable:  
  `CANDIDATE_ID=[YOUR CANDIDATE ID]`

## Run
To try the solution for yourself simply run the following commands:  
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run start`
